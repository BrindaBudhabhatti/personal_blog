        <h1>About Me <br><br></h1>
        <p><b>My Story: </b> <br></p>
        <p>As a kid, I was always taking things apart to see how they worked.  This curiosity naturally led me to computers <br>
          and tinkering with them.  Learning about how to code was like unlocking a secret language for these machines, <br>
          and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me.  When I discovered AI and ML, it was like stepping <br>
          into the future!  These fields are constantly evolving, and there's so much potential to create new things <br>
          and solve problems that we can't even imagine yet.</p>

        <br> <br>
        <p><b>My Approach: </b> <br></p>
        <p>I believe that anyone can learn to code and explore technology. It's all about <br>
           asking questions, trying new things, and not giving up when things get tough. I <br>
           also think it's important to have fun while you're learning!</p>
